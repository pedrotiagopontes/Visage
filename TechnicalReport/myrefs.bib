abstract = {We develop a face recognition algorithm which is insensitive to large variation in lighting direction and facial expression. Taking a pattern classification approach, we consider each pixel in an image as a coordinate in a high-dimensional space. We take advantage of the observation that the images of a particular face, under varying illumination but fixed pose, lie in a 3D linear subspace of the high dimensional image space-if the face is a Lambertian surface without shadowing. However, since faces are not truly Lambertian surfaces and do indeed produce self-shadowing, images will deviate from this linear subspace. Rather than explicitly modeling this deviation, we linearly project the image into a subspace in a manner which discounts those regions of the face with large deviation. Our projection method is based on Fisher's linear discriminant and produces well separated classes in a low-dimensional subspace, even under severe variation in lighting and facial expressions. The eigenface technique, another method based on linearly projecting the image space to a low dimensional subspace, has similar computational requirements. Yet, extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed “Fisherface” method has error rates that are lower than those of the eigenface technique for tests on the Harvard and Yale face databases},

@article{Biswas2009,
abstract = {We present a nonstationary stochastic filtering framework for the task of albedo estimation from a single image. There are several approaches in the literature for albedo estimation, but few include the errors in estimates of surface normals and light source direction to improve the albedo estimate. The proposed approach effectively utilizes the error statistics of surface normals and illumination direction for robust estimation of albedo, for images illuminated by single and multiple light sources. The albedo estimate obtained is subsequently used to generate albedo-free normalized images for recovering the shape of an object. Traditional Shape-from-Shading (SFS) approaches often assume constant/piecewise constant albedo and known light source direction to recover the underlying shape. Using the estimated albedo, the general problem of estimating the shape of an object with varying albedo map and unknown illumination source is reduced to one that can be handled by traditional SFS approaches. Experimental results are provided to show the effectiveness of the approach and its application to illumination-invariant matching and shape recovery. The estimated albedo maps are compared with the ground truth. The maps are used as illumination-invariant signatures for the task of face recognition across illumination variations. The recognition results obtained compare well with the current state-of-the-art approaches. Impressive shape recovery results are obtained using images downloaded from the Web with little control over imaging conditions. The recovered shapes are also used to synthesize novel views under novel illumination conditions.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for face recognition across variations in pose, ranging from frontal to profile views, and across a wide range of illuminations, including cast shadows and specular reflections. To account for these variations, the algorithm simulates the process of image formation in 3D space, using computer graphics, and it estimates 3D shape and texture of faces from single images. The estimate is achieved by fitting a statistical, morphable model of 3D faces to images. The model is learned from a set of textured 3D scans of heads. We describe the construction of the morphable model, an algorithm to fit the model to images, and a framework for face identification. In this framework, faces are represented by model parameters for 3D shape and texture. We present results obtained with 4,488 images from the publicly available CMU-PIE database and 1,940 images from the FERET database.},

@article{Chellappa1995,
abstract = {The goal of this paper is to present a critical survey of existing literature on human and machine recognition of faces. Machine recognition of faces has several applications, ranging from static matching of controlled photographs as in mug shots matching and credit card verification to surveillance video images. Such applications have different constraints in terms of complexity of processing requirements and thus present a wide range of different technical challenges. Over the last 20 years researchers in psychophysics, neural sciences and engineering, image processing analysis and computer vision have investigated a number of issues related to face recognition by humans and machines. Ongoing research activities have been given a renewed emphasis over the last five years. Existing techniques and systems have been tested on different sets of images of varying complexities. But very little synergism exists between studies in psychophysics and the engineering literature. Most importantly, there exists no evaluation or benchmarking studies using large databases with the image quality that arises in commercial and law enforcement applications In this paper, we first present different applications of face recognition in commercial and law enforcement sectors. This is followed by a brief overview of the literature on face recognition in the psychophysics community. We then present a detailed overview of move than 20 years of research done in the engineering community. Techniques for segmentation/location of the face, feature extraction and recognition are reviewed. Global transform and feature based methods using statistical, structural and neural classifiers are summarized},

@article{Etemad1997,
abstract = {The discrimination power of various human facial features is studied and a new scheme for automatic face recognition (AFR) is proposed. The first part of the paper focuses on the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) of different aspects of human faces in the spatial as well as in the wavelet domain. This analysis allows objective evaluation of the significance of visual information in different parts (features) of the face for identifying the human subject. The LDA of faces also provides us with a small set of features that carry the most relevant information for classification purposes. The features are obtained through eigenvector analysis of scatter matrices with the objective of maximizing between-class variations and minimizing within-class variations. The result is an efficient projection-based feature-extraction and classification scheme for AFR. Each projection creates a decision axis with a certain level of discrimination power or reliability. Soft decisions made based on each of the projections are combined, and probabilistic or evidential approaches to multisource data analysis are used to provide more reliable recognition results. For a medium-sized database of human faces, excellent classification accuracy is achieved with the use of very-low-dimensional feature vectors. Moreover, the method used is general and is applicable to many other image-recognition tasks.},

abstract = {Two important visual properties of paintings and painting-like images are the absence of texture details and the increased sharpness of edges as compared to photographic images. Painting-like artistic effects can be achieved from photographic images by filters that smooth out texture details, while preserving or enhancing edges and corners. However, not all edge preserving smoothers are suitable for this purpose. We present a simple nonlinear local operator that generalizes both the well known Kuwahara filter and the more general class of filters known in the literature as ldquocriterion and value filter structure.rdquo This class of operators suffers from intrinsic theoretical limitations which give rise to a dramatic instability in presence of noise, especially on shadowed areas. Such limitations are discussed in the paper and overcome by the proposed operator. A large variety of experimental results shows that the output of the proposed operator is visually similar to a painting. Comparisons with existing techniques on a large set of natural images highlight conditions on which traditional edge preserving smoothers fail, whereas our approach produces good results. In particular, unlike many other well established approaches, the proposed operator is robust to degradations of the input image such as blurring and noise contamination.},

There are several related subproblems: detection of a pattern as a face, identification of the face, analysis of facial expressions, and classification based on physical features of the face. A system that performs these operations will find many applications, e.g. criminal identification, authentication in secure systems, etc. Most of the work to date has been in identification. This paper surveys the past work in solving these problems. The capability of the human visual system with respect to these problems is also discussed.

It combines gray levels or colors based on both their geometric closeness and their photometric similarity, and prefers near values to distant values in both domain and range. In contrast with filters that operate on the three bands of a color image separately, a bilateral filter can enforce the perceptual metric underlying the CIE-Lab color space, and smooth colors and preserve edges in a way that is tuned to human perception. Also, in contrast with standard filtering, bilateral filtering produces no phantom colors along edges in color images, and reduces phantom colors where they appear in the original image},

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as "eigenfaces," because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, an...},

abstract = {Images containing faces are essential to intelligent vision-based human-computer interaction, and research efforts in face processing include face recognition, face tracking, pose estimation and expression recognition. However, many reported methods assume that the faces in an image or an image sequence have been identified and localized. To build fully automated systems that analyze the information contained in face images, robust and efficient face detection algorithms are required. Given a single image, the goal of face detection is to identify all image regions which contain a face, regardless of its 3D position, orientation and lighting conditions. Such a problem is challenging because faces are non-rigid and have a high degree of variability in size, shape, color and texture. Numerous techniques have been developed to detect faces in a single image, and the purpose of this paper is to categorize and evaluate these algorithms. We also discuss relevant issues such as data collection, evaluation metrics and benchmarking. After analyzing these algorithms and identifying their limitations, we conclude with several promising directions for future research},

The method consists of two steps: first we project the face image from the original vector space to a face subspace via PCA, second we use LDA to obtain a best linear classifier. The basic idea of combining PCA and LDA is to improve the generalization capability of LDA when only few samples per class are available. Using PCA, we are able to construct a face subspace in which we apply LDA to perform classification. Using FERET dataset we demonstrate a significant improvement when principal components rather than original images are fed to the LDA classifier. The hybrid classifier using PCA and LDA provides a useful framework for other image recognition tasks as well},

Psychophysicists and neuroscien- tists have been concerned with issues such as whether face perception is a dedicated process and whether it is done holistically or by local feature analysis.
During the early and mid-1970s, typical pattern clas- sification techniques, which use measured attributes of features (e.g., the distances between important points) in faces or face profiles, were used [Bledsoe 1964; Kanade 1973;Kelly 1970]
